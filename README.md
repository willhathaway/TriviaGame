# TriviaGame

This Trivia Game was primarily a challenge to use JavaScript and jQuery to create a timed multiple-choice quiz. I also used it as an opportunity to improve my understanding of and familiarity with navigating objects, by putting the questions inside an object and building the quiz with DOM manipulation and a loop through the object.
